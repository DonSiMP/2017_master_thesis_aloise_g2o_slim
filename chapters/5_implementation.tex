\chapter{Software Implementation of the Optimizer}\label{ch:implementation}
This Chapter will better analyze the actual implementation of a 3D Optimizer. In particular, it has been developed a self-consistent C++ library that provides all the tools needed to create and optimize 3D graphs that contain \textit{pose} or \textit{point} objects.
